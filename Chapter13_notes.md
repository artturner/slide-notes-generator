## Slide 1: Elements of the Criminal Justice System
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 3.09s -->
**I. Crimes classified as felonies or misdemeanors under Texas Penal Code**
  A. The Texas Penal Code categorizes offenses into felonies, which are more serious crimes, and misdemeanors, which are less severe, to establish a clear legal framework for prosecution.
  B. This classification helps determine the appropriate legal consequences and judicial processes based on the nature and gravity of the crime committed.

**II. Punishments range from fines to imprisonment depending on crime severity**
  A. The severity of a crime dictates the type of punishment, with minor offenses often resulting in fines, while more serious crimes may lead to imprisonment.
  B. This graduated approach ensures that penalties are proportionate to the offense, aiming to balance justice with rehabilitation opportunities.

**III. Local law enforcement resources influence law application**
  A. The availability and capacity of local law enforcement agencies play a critical role in how laws are enforced and crimes are addressed within a community.
  B. Variations in resources, such as personnel and funding, can impact the consistency and effectiveness of law application across different regions.

  A. Felonies are ranked from the most serious, capital felonies, down to the least severe, state-jail felonies, reflecting the range of punishment severity.
  B. Misdemeanors are classified from Class A, the most serious, to Class C, the least serious, indicating varying degrees of penalties for lesser offenses.

**II. Enhanced punishments are applied for specific types of criminal behavior**
  A. Individuals involved in repeat offenses, organized crime, or hate crimes face harsher penalties to deter such persistent or targeted criminal activity.
  B. These enhancements aim to address the broader societal impact and increased harm caused by these specific categories of crime.

**III. Murder can escalate to a capital felony under certain conditions**
  A. When murder involves aggravating circumstances, such as extreme brutality or specific victim targeting, it may be classified as a capital felony.
  B. This classification often results in the possibility of the death penalty or life imprisonment, reflecting the severity of the crime.

---

## Slide 3: Criminal Justice Policy
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 4.51s -->
**I. Policy shaped by public opinion, budget, and court rulings**
  A. Public opinion in Texas often demands a tough stance on crime, influencing policymakers to prioritize strict laws and enforcement measures.

**II. Texas incarceration rate among highest worldwide**
  A. Texas incarcerates a significantly larger percentage of its population compared to other democratic nations, reflecting a strong emphasis on imprisonment.
  B. This high rate contributes to substantial financial burdens on the state, as maintaining large prison populations requires extensive resources.

**III. Racial and ethnic disparities persist in enforcement and sentencing**
  A. Enforcement practices and sentencing outcomes in Texas often disproportionately affect people of color, highlighting systemic inequities.

  B. This sentencing option addresses ethical concerns about taking a life while still imposing a significant punishment for serious crimes.

**III. Studies indicating no deterrent effect of the death penalty compared to non-death penalty states**
  A. Research consistently shows that the death penalty does not reduce crime rates more effectively than long-term imprisonment in states without capital punishment.
  B. These findings challenge the traditional argument that the death penalty serves as a unique deterrent to violent crime.

**IV. Certain offenders exempt from the death penalty based on specific criteria**
  A. Exemptions apply to individuals based on factors such as age, intellectual disability, or mental incompetence, reflecting legal and ethical considerations.
  B. These exemptions aim to prevent unjust application of the death penalty to vulnerable populations who may not fully comprehend their actions.

**V. Legislative efforts to standardize disability determinations for exemptions have failed**
  A. Attempts to create uniform guidelines for assessing intellectual disability in death penalty cases have not succeeded, leading to inconsistencies across jurisdictions.
