## Slide 2: Local Politics in ContextLocal Governments and Federalism
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 7.89s -->
**I. Local governments guided by Dillon's Rule or Cooley Doctrine, with Texas strictly adhering to Dillon's Rule, which restricts local autonomy**
  A. Dillon's Rule, strictly followed in Texas, limits local governments to only those powers explicitly granted by the state, reducing their ability to act independently.
  B. In contrast, the Cooley Doctrine, not followed in Texas, would allow local governments inherent rights to self-governance, but Texas's adherence to Dillon's Rule significantly curtails such autonomy.

**II. Local governments in Texas depend on state and federal funding, often facing unfunded mandates that affect policy implementation**
  A. Texas local governments rely heavily on financial support from state and federal levels, which can dictate the scope and direction of local policies.
  B. Unfunded mandates, where requirements are imposed without accompanying funds, create challenges for local governments in effectively implementing necessary policies and programs.

**III. In disaster situations, Texas frequently depends on national aid, necessitating extensive interaction across all levels of government**
  A. During disasters, Texas local governments often require national assistance, highlighting the need for coordinated efforts between local, state, and federal entities.
  B. This reliance on national aid underscores the importance of clear communication and resource sharing among government levels to address emergency needs effectively.

**IV. Federalism at the local level involves interactions among overlapping jurisdictions, where local governments may collaborate or conflict over resources and policies**
  A. Local governments operate within a complex federalist system, often dealing with overlapping jurisdictions that require negotiation and cooperation on shared issues.
  B. Conflicts can arise over limited resources or differing policy priorities, while collaboration can lead to more effective solutions for community-wide challenges.

<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 7.12s -->
**I. Texans seeking solutions for crime, infrastructure, education, and healthcare issues**
  A. Many Texans are concerned about pressing local issues such as rising crime rates, deteriorating roads and bridges, underfunded schools, and limited access to healthcare services.
  B. Addressing these challenges requires active engagement from both citizens and local policymakers to prioritize and allocate resources effectively.

**II. Diverse cities needing equal public service access for all communities**
  A. As Texas cities grow more diverse, ensuring that all racial and ethnic groups have fair access to public services like transportation, housing, and emergency response is critical.
  B. Local governments must work to eliminate disparities and build inclusive policies that cater to the needs of every community.

**III. Citizen participation through voting, running for office, and volunteering**
  A. Active involvement in local politics, such as casting votes in elections, campaigning for public office, or volunteering for community initiatives, empowers citizens to shape their governance.
  B. These actions help ensure that local leaders are accountable and responsive to the specific needs of their constituents.

**IV. Voter apathy as a challenge to grassroots government and the role of understanding in increasing participation**
  A. Voter apathy, or the lack of interest in participating in elections, poses a significant barrier to effective grassroots governance, often resulting in unrepresentative decision-making.
  B. Educating citizens about the importance of their vote and the direct impact of local policies on their lives can motivate greater involvement in the political process.

## Slide 4: Municipal GovernmentsLegal Status
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 7.27s -->
**I. Texas classification of cities into general-law and home-rule categories**
  A. Texas categorizes its cities into two distinct types: general-law cities, numbering almost 900 and typically smaller in population, and home-rule cities, numbering about 350 and generally larger in size.
  B. This classification impacts the legal framework and governance structure under which each type of city operates, reflecting differences in population and administrative autonomy.

**II. General-law cities adopting charters prescribed by the Texas Legislature**
  A. General-law cities are established in communities with a population of 201 or more, following a charter that is predefined by state legislation.
  B. This prescribed charter limits the scope of local governance, as it must adhere strictly to the guidelines set forth by the Texas Legislature.

**III. Home-rule cities drafting local charters for larger populations**
  A. Home-rule cities, applicable to populations exceeding 5,000, create their own charters locally, which define critical aspects such as powers, salaries, terms, and operational procedures.
  B. This local drafting process allows for customization of governance to better suit the specific needs and preferences of the city's residents.

**IV. Greater flexibility and unique powers in home-rule cities**
  A. Home-rule cities enjoy enhanced flexibility in governance, enabling them to adapt more readily to local issues and community demands compared to general-law cities.
  B. They also possess unique powers such as recall, initiative, and referendum, which provide residents with direct mechanisms to influence local government decisions.

## Slide 5: Municipal GovernmentsForms of Municipal Government (1 of 2)
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 7.79s -->
**I. Strong Mayor-Council: Mayor as Chief Administrator and Political Head**
  A. In the strong mayor-council form, the mayor serves as the primary executive, overseeing administrative functions and acting as the leading political figure in the city.
  B. This structure grants the mayor significant authority to shape policy and direct municipal operations, often positioning them as the central decision-maker.

**II. Strong Mayor-Council: Mayor Elected at Large with Appointment and Removal Power**
  A. The mayor is elected by the entire city population, ensuring broad representation, and holds the power to appoint and remove key municipal officials.
  B. This authority allows the mayor to build a loyal administration but can raise concerns about unchecked influence over city governance.

**III. Strong Mayor-Council: Critics Argue Potential for Corruption**
  A. Critics of the strong mayor-council system highlight that concentrated power in the mayor’s hands may lead to favoritism or misuse of authority.
  B. Without sufficient checks and balances, there is a risk of corruption, as the mayor’s decisions may lack adequate oversight from other elected bodies.

**IV. Weak Mayor-Council: Mayor Shares Power with City Council**
  A. In the weak mayor-council form, the mayor’s authority is significantly reduced, with power distributed more evenly between the mayor and the city council.
  B. This shared governance structure aims to prevent any single official from dominating decision-making, fostering collaboration among elected representatives.

**V. Weak Mayor-Council: Used by Smaller Cities with Limited Mayor Powers**
  A. This form is commonly adopted by smaller cities where the mayor’s role is more ceremonial, with limited control over administrative or policy decisions.
  B. The restricted powers ensure that the mayor cannot unilaterally influence city operations, often requiring council approval for major actions.

**VI. Weak Mayor-Council: Day-to-Day Operations Managed by a City Administrator**
  A. Unlike the strong mayor system, day-to-day municipal operations in the weak mayor-council form are typically handled by a professional city administrator.
  B. This setup allows for more specialized management of city affairs, reducing the mayor’s direct involvement in routine governance tasks.

## Slide 6: Municipal GovernmentsForms of Municipal Government (2 of 2)
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 6.11s -->
**I. Council-Manager Form Dominates in Texas's Home-Rule Cities**
  A. This form is prevalent in approximately 90% of Texas's home-rule cities, highlighting its widespread adoption as a preferred structure for municipal governance.
  B. It reflects a professional management approach, where administrative efficiency is prioritized through the appointment of a city manager to handle daily operations.

**II. Limited Powers of Mayor in Council-Manager Form**
  A. Under this system, the mayor's role is largely ceremonial or symbolic, with restricted authority over policy implementation or executive decisions.
  B. The city manager, appointed by the council, takes on the responsibility of executing decisions and managing city affairs, reducing the mayor's direct influence.

**III. Criticism of Council-Manager Form for Lack of Clear Leadership**
  A. Critics argue that the absence of a strong, identifiable leader can confuse citizens who may struggle to understand who is ultimately accountable for city governance.
  B. This structure may lead to a perceived disconnect between the public and decision-makers, as the city manager is not directly elected by the people.

**IV. Commission Form Manages Departments Individually**
  A. In the commission form, each city department is overseen by a single commissioner, creating a fragmented administrative structure with specialized oversight.
  B. This setup allows for focused management of specific areas but can result in coordination challenges across departments due to the lack of centralized authority.

**V. Rarity and Criticism of Commission Form in Texas**
  A. The commission form is uncommon in Texas, as it has fallen out of favor compared to other governance models like the council-manager system.
  B. It is often criticized for lacking a chief executive to provide unified leadership, which can hinder cohesive policy-making and efficient city management.

## Slide 7: Municipal PoliticsRules Make a Difference (1 of 2)
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 4.52s -->
**I. Nonpartisan nature of city and special district elections contributes to low voter turnout and personality-driven campaigns**
  A. Since municipal elections are officially nonpartisan, lacking party labels, voters often have less motivation to participate, resulting in lower turnout.
  B. Without party affiliations, campaigns tend to focus on individual candidates’ personalities and personal appeal rather than policy platforms.

**II. Municipal elections organized as at-large with citywide voting are declining, with only 3 of Texas’s 25 largest cities using this system by 2025**
  A. At-large elections involve citywide voting for council members, which historically favored majority groups but are now less common in larger Texas cities.
  B. The shift away from at-large systems reflects a broader trend toward other electoral structures that aim to address representation imbalances.

**III. Many larger Texas cities now use single-member districts to enhance ethnic representation in municipal elections**
  A. Single-member districts allow voters to elect candidates from their specific geographic area, increasing the likelihood of diverse representation.
  B. This system helps ensure that ethnic minorities have a better chance of electing representatives who reflect their communities’ interests.

**IV. Redistricting every 10 years based on census data impacts representation in municipal governments**
  A. Governments must redraw district boundaries every decade to account for population changes, ensuring fair and equitable representation.
  B. This process can significantly alter political power dynamics, potentially affecting which groups gain or lose influence in local governance.

## Slide 8: Municipal PoliticsRules Make a Difference (2 of 2)
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 4.20s -->
**I. Cumulative voting in local governments to enhance minority representation**
  A. Cumulative voting allows voters to distribute their votes among candidates in a way that can help minority groups elect representatives by concentrating their votes on preferred candidates.
  B. This system is designed to provide a fairer chance for underrepresented communities to gain seats in local government, addressing historical disparities in representation.

**II. Term limits in home-rule cities and their impact on government performance**
  A. Home-rule cities have the authority to set term limits for elected officials, a policy often favored by the public as a means to prevent entrenched power and encourage fresh perspectives.
  B. Despite their popularity, term limits rarely lead to significant improvements in government performance, as they can disrupt continuity and institutional knowledge among officials.

**III. Variation in term lengths among the largest cities in early 2025**
  A. In early 2025, four of the six largest cities implemented four-year terms for their officials, providing longer periods for policy implementation and reducing frequent campaigning.
  B. The remaining two cities maintained two-year terms, which can lead to more frequent elections and potentially greater accountability but also more time spent on campaigning rather than governing.

## Slide 11: Municipal PoliticsMunicipal Government Revenue
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 4.28s -->
**I. Taxes as a Primary Revenue Source**
  A. Taxes, including property and sales taxes, form a critical part of municipal revenue, providing essential funds for city services.
  B. However, these sources are constrained by external factors such as state-imposed caps and economic variability, limiting their reliability.

**II. Property Taxes: Significant but Restricted**
  A. Property taxes are a major revenue stream for municipalities, often funding core services like public safety and infrastructure.
  B. State caps on property tax rates restrict the ability of cities to increase this revenue, creating financial challenges for local governments.

**III. Sales Taxes: Economic Sensitivity**
  A. Sales taxes contribute significantly to municipal budgets but are highly dependent on economic conditions, leading to unpredictable revenue streams.
  B. For instance, Westlake experienced a 25% drop in sales tax revenue in 2024, illustrating the vulnerability of this source during economic downturns.

**IV. Fees: A Growing Revenue Alternative**
  A. Due to limitations on tax revenue, municipalities are increasingly relying on fees to cover the costs of services and operations.
  B. These fees, such as utility charges or licensing costs, are becoming a vital tool for cities to address budget shortfalls caused by tax constraints.

---

## Slide 12: Municipal Government Revenue
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 3.44s -->
**I. Bonds and Certificates of Obligation**
  A. These financial instruments are used by municipal governments to fund projects, but they require voter approval before issuance.
  B. Their use often contributes to high levels of local debt, placing a long-term financial burden on the city.

**II. Property Taxes and Tax Exemptions**
  A. Texas provides homestead exemptions, tax freezes, and caps to reduce the property tax burden on seniors, disabled individuals, and veterans.
  B. While these measures offer relief to specific groups, they significantly decrease the revenue available to cities for public services.

**III. The Bottom Line**
  A. To avoid increasing property tax rates, municipal governments often resort to strategies like cutting services, freezing hiring, or raising fees for existing services.
  B. Other approaches include privatizing certain services or focusing on boosting productivity to maintain operations with limited funds.
