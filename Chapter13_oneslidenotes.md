**II. Past Focus on Felony Expansion, Longer Sentences, and Prison Construction**

**III. Shift Toward Rehabilitation and Reentry Reduced Imprisonment Rates Since 2010**
  A. Since 2010, Texas has moved toward emphasizing rehabilitation programs and reentry initiatives to help inmates reintegrate into society.
  B. This shift has contributed to a decline in imprisonment rates by focusing on reducing recidivism through support and skill-building programs.

**II. Services like calls, e-messages, and media often carry high fees**
  A. Additional services on tablets, such as phone calls and streaming media, come with significant charges that can burden inmates and their families financially.

**III. Contraband like drugs and cell phones prompt lockdowns and stricter mail policies**
  A. The presence of illegal items such as drugs and cell phones in prisons leads to security measures like facility-wide lockdowns to address safety concerns.
  B. Stricter policies, including digital mail systems, are implemented to curb smuggling and reduce the influx of contraband through traditional channels.

**IV. DNA testing aids in suspect identification and wrongful conviction exonerations**
  A. DNA technology plays a crucial role in identifying suspects, providing law enforcement with a powerful tool to solve crimes more accurately.
