Texans seek solutions for crime, infrastructure, education, and healthcare issues.
Majority of Texans, around 85%, live in urban areas and face various challenges.
Fear of crime and controversies regarding the role of police is a major concern.
The state of public infrastructure such as streets and bridges is a significant issue.
There are ongoing debates about the quality and future of public schools.
Healthcare, particularly the response to recent pandemics, is a pressing concern.

Diverse cities need equal public service access for all communities.
Texas is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse, with increasing numbers of Black and Latino residents.
These communities are striving to gain access to public services and local power structures that have been historically dominated by White leaders.
Ensuring that all communities receive equitable access to public services is a critical challenge for policymakers and activists.

Citizen participation varies from voting, running for office to volunteering.
Opportunities for civic engagement include voting in local elections, running for offices like city council or school board, and volunteering for advisory boards.
Other forms of involvement include participation in homeowners’ or neighborhood associations, voter registration drives, election campaign work, speaking at hearings, and volunteering with community groups.
Gaining influence in local governmental bodies can empower individuals and groups to address grassroots issues.

Voter apathy challenges grassroots government; understanding increases participation.
Widespread voter apathy is a significant problem, with often fewer than 10% of qualified voters participating in local elections.
Greater involvement is seen when citizens understand the impact they can make through participation in local governance.
Education about the importance and influence of local government and civic participation can be a way to combat this apathy.
