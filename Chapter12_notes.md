  A. Public policy encompasses the actions taken by government to address specific societal needs or achieve particular objectives for the public good.
  B. It reflects the priorities and decisions made by officials to solve problems or improve conditions within a community or state.

**II. Public policy includes varied forms of government response**
  A. This concept covers not only active measures and programs but also instances of delayed action or complete inaction by the government.
  B. Such variations in response can significantly impact how and when public needs are addressed, shaping public perception and outcomes.

**III. Example of delayed action in public policy**
  A. A specific instance is the 2022 maternal mortality report in Texas, which was delayed and not released until 2024, illustrating delayed government action.

  A. This model highlights the importance of formal government institutions, such as legislatures and bureaucracies, in shaping public policy.
  B. It emphasizes how the design and operation of these structures influence the policy-making process and outcomes.

**II. Group model emphasizes group interactions and interests as policy drivers**
  A. This approach centers on the role of various interest groups in politics, viewing policy as the result of their competing demands and negotiations.
  B. It suggests that understanding group dynamics and their specific interests is key to explaining why certain policies are adopted over others.

**III. Elite model suggests policy reflects preferences of social and economic elites**
  A. According to this model, public policy primarily serves the interests of a small, powerful group of social and economic elites rather than the general public.
  B. It posits that these elites shape policy through their influence and control over resources, often sidelining broader public opinion.

**IV. Rational model weighs costs and benefits but is rarely used in practice**
  A. This model advocates for a systematic approach to policy-making by evaluating the potential costs and benefits of different options before deciding.
  B. Despite its logical appeal, it is infrequently applied in real-world scenarios due to time constraints and the complexity of political environments.

**V. Incremental model sees new policies as slight modifications of existing ones**
  A. This perspective views policy-making as a gradual process where new policies are typically small adjustments to previous ones rather than complete overhauls.
  B. It reflects the practical constraints of time and resources that prevent comprehensive reviews of all existing policies.

## Slide 4: The Institutional Context
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 6.21s -->
**I. Texas’s fragmented executive branch reduces public visibility of agencies**
  A. The fragmented structure of the Texas executive branch means that numerous agencies operate with limited oversight, making their actions less transparent to the general public.
  B. This lack of visibility can result in reduced accountability, as citizens are often unaware of the specific roles and decisions made by these agencies.

**II. This structure gives special interests and elites greater access to decision-makers**
  A. The decentralized nature of the executive branch allows special interest groups and elites to target specific agencies or decision-makers directly, bypassing broader public scrutiny.
  B. Such access often enables these groups to influence policy decisions in ways that may prioritize their interests over those of the general population.

**III. Studies confirm a strong role for interest groups and elites in Texas policymaking**
  A. Research highlights that interest groups and elites frequently play a dominant role in shaping policy outcomes in Texas due to their ability to leverage relationships within the fragmented system.
