<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 7.63s -->
**I. Diluting Votes through Gerrymandering**
  A. After each census, states redraw district maps, and this process is frequently manipulated through gerrymandering to intentionally reduce the voting power of specific demographic groups.
  B. This manipulation can target political or racial groups by strategically altering district boundaries to favor one party or diminish the influence of certain voters.

**II. Tactics of Cracking and Packing**
  A. "Cracking" refers to the practice of splitting minority voters across multiple districts, thereby diluting their collective voting strength and preventing them from forming a majority in any single district.
  B. "Packing" involves concentrating minority voters into a small number of districts, ensuring they have overwhelming majorities in those areas but limiting their influence in surrounding districts.

**III. Legal Aspects of Racial Gerrymandering**
  A. Discriminatory racial gerrymandering, which intentionally harms minority voters by reducing their electoral power, is deemed illegal under federal law.
  B. Conversely, affirmative racial gerrymandering is permitted, allowing the creation of majority–minority districts to enhance electoral opportunities for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.

  A. These stringent rules create barriers for volunteers who aim to assist in registering new voters, often requiring extensive training or certification.
  B. As a result, the process becomes less efficient, leading to fewer individuals being registered to vote in Texas communities.

**II. Texas requires a photo ID to vote, but student IDs are excluded; critics argue this disenfranchises marginalized groups.**
  A. The exclusion of student IDs as valid identification means many young voters, particularly college students, may struggle to meet voting requirements.
  B. Critics highlight that this policy disproportionately affects marginalized and low-income groups who may lack access to other acceptable forms of ID.

**III. Texas laws passed in 2021 banned 24-hour and drive-through voting, tightened vote-by-mail rules, and restricted unsolicited mail ballot applications.**
  A. The elimination of 24-hour and drive-through voting options reduces accessibility for individuals with limited time or mobility to cast their ballots.

---

## Slide 19: Voter ParticipationVoter Turnout
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 4.33s -->
**I. Voter turnout calculation methods vary by denominator**
  A. Voter turnout can be measured using three distinct groups—voting-age population (all individuals 18 or older), voting-eligible population (those legally allowed to vote), or registered voters—leading to different percentages for the same election.
  B. Each method provides a unique perspective on participation, as the choice of denominator significantly alters the interpretation of how many people engaged in the voting process.

**II. 2024 general election turnout illustrates denominator impact**
  A. In the 2024 general election, turnout was reported as 48.4% of the voting-age population, 56.51% of the voting-eligible population, and 61.15% of registered voters, highlighting stark differences based on the calculation method.
  B. These varying figures demonstrate how the choice of denominator can shape conclusions about voter engagement, with higher percentages among registered voters suggesting greater participation within that specific group.

**III. Local election turnout often lower but can be improved**
  A. Turnout in local elections is typically much lower compared to general elections, reflecting less public interest or awareness of local issues and candidates.

<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 4.20s -->
**I. Short-Term vs. Long-Term Influences on Voter Decisions**
  A. Short-term influences include candidate traits, specific issue positions, and evaluations of government performance, which can change from one election to another and impact voter choices in the immediate context.
  B. Long-term influences, such as party identification and political ideology, are more stable over time and provide a consistent framework through which voters interpret candidates and issues.

**II. Information Sources & Engagement in Shaping Voter Perceptions**
  A. Voters acquire information about candidates from diverse sources like websites, media outlets, and campaign materials, which play a critical role in forming their opinions and preferences.
  B. The accuracy and neutrality of these sources can vary significantly, influencing how voters perceive candidates and issues, often leading to biased or incomplete understandings.

---

## Slide 23: The Vote ChoiceDeciding Whom to Vote For
<!-- Generated using grok-3 in 5.19s -->
**I. Voters overwhelmingly support candidates from their affiliated party—90% of Democrats voted for Harris and 90% of Republicans for Trump in 2024**
  A. This strong correlation highlights the significant role party identification plays in shaping voter behavior during elections.
  B. Such high percentages indicate a deep loyalty to party lines, influencing the predictability of election outcomes in partisan races.

**II. In judicial and county elections, where candidate information is scarce, voters often rely on party labels to guide their choices**
  A. Due to limited visibility and information about candidates in lower-profile races, party affiliation becomes a critical decision-making shortcut for many voters.
  B. This reliance on party labels can significantly impact the election of local officials, even when voters may not be familiar with specific policy positions.

**III. Voters with favorable views of a candidate are far more likely to support them**
  A. Positive perceptions of a candidate, whether based on personality, past performance, or campaign messaging, heavily influence voter support.
