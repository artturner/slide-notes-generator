## Slide 3: Municipal Governments: Legal Status
### Content Overview
- Texas classifies cities as general-law (almost 900, mostly smaller cities) or home-rule (about 350, mostly larger cities).
General-law cities adopt a charter prescribed by Texas legislature (for communities of 201+ people).
Home-rule cities draft a local charter (for cities of 5,000+ people) that outlines powers, salaries, terms, and procedures for city operations.
Home-rule cities have greater flexibility and unique powers like recall, initiative, and referendum.

City government powers are outlined and restricted by municipal charters, state
and national constitutions, and statutes (laws). Texas has two legal classifica-
tions of cities: general-law cities  and home-rule cities. A community with a
population of 201 or more may become a general-law city by adopting a charter
prescribed by a general law enacted by the Texas Legislature.
